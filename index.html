        <h1>Let's play Pig Dice</h1>
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p>Each turn, a player rolls a die until a 1 is rolled or they decide to stop and pass turn.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
            <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins!</li>
          </ul>
