# Pig Dice

##### Two players play Pig Dice

#### By Brittany Kerr and Nathan Stewart

## Description

This program allows multiple players to play pig dice. If the player rolls a one, the program alerts the player that their turn is over and does not allow them to score on that turn. The program totals up the rolled numbers for each turn and adds it to a grand total.  When a player reaches 100 the program notifies them that they won.
